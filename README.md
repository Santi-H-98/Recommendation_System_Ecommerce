Design of a recommendation system for an Ecommerce. Project developed with educational purposes.

The dataset contain the scores (0 - 5) of the users for every buy thing that they bought. It doesn't has information about the product, only the internal ID. 

The goal of the project is to develop a recommendation system that be able to reccomend 20 product to every user. Those products can't have been purchased by the user, must be unknown products for them. 

For the new users who didn't buy in the past, design a criterion that recommend them the most popular products.

Finally, the system must deliver a table with the ID of every user and makes 20 reccomendations.

The system will be evaluated with MAP score.
